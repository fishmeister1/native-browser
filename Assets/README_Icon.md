# App Icon Placeholder
# This is a placeholder for the app icon. In a real application, you would place an actual .ico file here.
# The icon should be 256x256 pixels for high DPI support and contain multiple sizes (16, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256).

# For now, you can create a simple icon using any icon creation tool or use the default Windows application icon.
# The XAML references "Assets/icon.ico" so place your icon file with that name in this directory.

# Example icon creation tools:
# - GIMP (free)
# - Paint.NET with icon plugin (free)
# - Online icon generators
# - Visual Studio Image Library
